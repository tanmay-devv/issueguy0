# issueguy0
Introducing issue guy, this is a simple yet powerfull tool that makes us (me) keep up with my weekly github contributions.
# Support
currently it supports only linux, but if you know your python, you can easily tweak the code to work it on Windows or Mac.

# Installation 
We can install it easily using the requirements file (will upload soon)
the most important is to set it up, the whole program works on 'pythonanywhere' we need to upload all the files over pythonanywhere, and then setup the time in the tasks section. After that we are done by running the 'run.py' file in the tasks section.
